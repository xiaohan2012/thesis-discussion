# Approach and (Re)Definition for Dynamic Topical Graph Summarization

# Notation

*Dynamic graph with topics*: \\(G = (V, E, \beta) \\)

$$ E = {(u_i, v_i, \alpha_i, t_i)} $$

with $$ i = 1 \ldots M $$ such that \\(u_i, v_i \in V \\), \\(\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}^{L}\\). \\( \beta \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times W} \\), where \\(W\\) is the vocabulary size for the topic model.

An event: \\( e \subseteq E\\).

Time span \\(t_1(e), t_2(e)\\) of \\(e\\): the minimum time span within which all interactions  in \\(e\\) happened.

---

# Recap: problem formulation

Given \\(G = (V, E, \beta)\\), a budget \\(A\\) on the time span for each event, find \\(K\\) events

$$ e_i, i=1 \ldots K $$

that maximizes

$$ \sum\limits_{i=1 \ldots K} q(e_i) $$

where \\(q(e_i)  \\) is some *quality function*.

under the constraint

$$ T(e) = t\_{2}(e\_i) - t\_{1}(e\_i) \le A $$

and a set of other problem-specific constraints \\(\mathcal{C}\\)

---

# Recap: one instantiation

Goal: find densely-connected subgraph under *topical coherence* constraint.

$$ q(e) = \frac{\vert E(V(e), \widetilde{V}(e)) \vert}{\sqrt{\vert V(e) \vert\vert \widetilde{V}(e)\vert}} $$

\\(V(e)\\): vertices covered by \\(e\\), \\(\widetilde{V}(e)\\): vertices not covered by \\(e\\), \\(E(S, T)\\) edges going from \\(S\\) to \\(T\\).

*Topic coherence* of \\(e\\):

$$ coherence(e) = \frac{1}{\vert e \vert} \sum\limits_{(u_i, v_i, \alpha_i, t_i) \in e} KL(\alpha_e, \alpha_i) $$

where  \\(KL(\alpha\_1, \alpha\_2)\\) is the KL-divergence and \\( \alpha\_e = \frac{1}{\vert e \vert} \sum\limits\_{(u\_i, v\_i, \alpha\_i, t\_i) \in e} \alpha\_i \\)

Constraint

$$ coherence(e_i) \ge B $$

# Algorithm


Input: \\(G = (V, E, \beta)\\), \\(K\\), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)

Output: \\( \mathcal{F}\\): \\(K\\) events

1. \\(\mathcal{F}^{'} \leftarrow \varnothing \\)
2. For \\(\\{G^{'} \vert G^{'} \text{ is subgraph of } G, T(G) \le A\\}\\) 
   1. \\( DG = \text{find-dense-and-topically-coherent-subgraph}(G^{'}, B) \\)
   2. \\(\mathcal{F}^{'} = \mathcal{F}^{'} \cup \\{DG\\}\\)
3. \\(\mathcal{F} = \text{sort}(\mathcal{F}^{'}, q)[1:K] \\)

# Find dense and topically coherent subgraph

Input: \\(G = (V, E, \beta)\\), \\(K\\) and \\(B\\)

Output: \\( F\\): a dense and topically coherent subgraph

One constraint on last step:

$$ coherence(G\_i) \ge B $$

# Issue

Top \\(K\\) events can have **overlapping** edges. 

- "duplicate" events
- temporally close
- semantically similar: sharing a lot of edges

Possible fix: 

- Using larger step size when sliding window
- How to decide the step size?

---

# Addressing "duplicacy" issue

**Partitioning** the *event graph*:

- vertex: event/subgraph of \\(G\\)
- edge with weight: measure the number/ratio of shared edges

Finally, take each partition as the "real" event.

---

# Benefit

- Fewer duplicates
- Capturing longer event

---

# Graph partition problem

Similar problem in [memtracking](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kdd09-quotes.pdf)(DAG partitioning)

DAG Partitioning(NP-hard): 

- Given a directed acyclic graph with edge  weights,  
- delete a set of edges of minimum total weight 
- so that each of the resulting components is single-rooted.

Copied from memtracking paper.

(Is our case simpler? The event graph is undirected but not necessarily acyclic?)

---

# Question

Now constraints might be broken:

- Longer time
- Less topically coherence
- Not necessarily \\(K\\) events

---

# Redefining problem?

Our problem is more like:

- Select a subset of edges in \\(G\\)
- Cluster/partition them

Now:

- How do we define the problem now? 
- What are we trying to maximize?
